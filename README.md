# -Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Analysis-Python-
Conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis on hotel booking data to identify key patterns influencing
reservation cancellations. Key insights include:
• Cancellation Rate: Approximately 37% of bookings were cancelled, significantly affecting hotel revenue.
• Booking Type Comparison: City hotels had more bookings than resort hotels, potentially due to cost
differences.
• Pricing Trends: Cancellations were higher on days with increased average daily rates, especially during
weekends and holidays.
• Monthly Trends: August recorded the highest number of both confirmed and cancelled reservations,
while January had the most cancellations.
• Country & Source Analysis: Portugal had the highest number of cancellations. Online travel agencies
accounted for 46% of bookings, while direct bookings were minimal.
